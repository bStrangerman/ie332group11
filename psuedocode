  Customer inputs filtering requirements
  Filter out unwanted locations
  Filter out locations without needed warehouse requirements (type, amenities)
  Decide if multiple warehouses are needed to meet size and find optimal solutions
  Sort on price or quality score or customer ratings

  Check the size on all warehouses
    Remove FALSE size warehouses
    if(size.warehouses[i] == sizeneeded)
    {
      warehousesleft <- c(warehousesleft, warehouse[i])
    }
  Check the Type on all TRUE size warehouses
    Remove FALSE types warehouses
    warehousesleft = NULL;
    if(type.warehouses[i] == typeneeded)
    {
      warehousesleft <- c(warehousesleft, warehouse[i])

Internal Quality Score:
Needs:
Location        | binary (if distance is met)        | int (sorted distances)
Warehouse Type  | binary (if need is met)            |
Size            | binary (if size is exceeded)       |
Price           | binary (if price is reasonable)    | int (sorted ascending)

Figure out priorities for search

We want to optimize our code when we discover our code takes too long

Maybe sort by state regions, such as if I want California, the algorith will check NV, OR, and AR before using the Google API.


Check Binaries
Ranking


Optimized Location Search:
Customer inputs wanted location of warehouse('s)
Filter only warehouses that are available during the requested dates
Take state of desired location
Keep only the desired state and a region of states around inputted state (e.g. IN will search OH, MI, IL, KY for warehouses)
If the list of warehouses is less than a predefined amount (i.e. 50), search the bordering states of the original bordering states for new DISTINCT warehouses.
e.g:
OH: PA, WV, KY, IN
KY: IN, OH, WV, VI, TN, IL
IL: IN, KY, MISSOURI, IOWA, WI
MI: WI, IL, IN, OH
Continue until a large enough sample size exists
Run the binary checks
Use Google API to calculate distance between warehouse and desired location
Sort on distance, customer rating, etc.
