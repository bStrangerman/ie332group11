Scheduling
input of when lessee wants the warehouse
SELECT calendar.StartDate, calendar.EndDate, spaces.Name
FROM calendar, spaces
WHERE calendar.SpaceId = spaces.SpaceID;
Check if the warehouse is available during dates between end date and start date

Can we book this warehouse?


(table.start > test.end AND table.start> test.start)
OR
(table.end <test.end AND table.end < test.start)

  Check the size on all warehouses
    Remove FALSE size warehouses
    if(size.warehouses[i] == sizeneeded)
    {
      warehousesleft <- c(warehousesleft, warehouse[i])
    }
  Check the Type on all TRUE size warehouses
    Remove FALSE types warehouses
    warehousesleft = NULL;
    if(type.warehouses[i] == typeneeded)
    {
      warehousesleft <- c(warehousesleft, warehouse[i])

Figure out priorities for search

We want to optimize our code when we discover our code takes too long

Maybe sort by state regions, such as if I want California, the algorithm will check NV, OR, and AR before using the Google API.



Good Pseudocode for Quality Check:
Get input from lessee on warehouse types
Verify all binary checks
--Location
--Warehouse Type
--Size
--Multiple Locations
--Amenities
--Available
--Price
If a warehouse passes a check make a new array with only those, run next check on new list



Optimized Location Search:
Customer inputs wanted location of warehouse('s)
Filter only warehouses that are available during the requested dates
Take state of desired location
Keep only the desired state and a region of states around inputted state (e.g. IN will search OH, MI, IL, KY for warehouses)
If the list of warehouses is less than a predefined amount (i.e. 50), search the bordering states of the original bordering states for new DISTINCT warehouses.
e.g:
OH: PA, WV, KY, IN
KY: IN, OH, WV, VI, TN, IL
IL: IN, KY, MISSOURI, IOWA, WI
MI: WI, IL, IN, OH
Continue until a large enough sample size exists
Run the binary checks
Use Google API to calculate distance between warehouse and desired location
Sort on distance, customer rating, etc.
