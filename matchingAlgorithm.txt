POST the inputs into the matching algorithm

Matching Algorithm
-Take inputs from the customer query
-Filter warehouses by geographic location within the distance radius provided by the customer
-Filter warehouses based on if it is available during the wanted time slot
-Filter warehouses based on warehouse types (e.g Frozen, Outside, Climate Controlled)
-Filter warehouses based on the wanted customer amenities
-Filter warehouses based on the security of the location, where any level greater than is wanted is shown. (e.g Lockers will display cameras and guards)
-Determine all the one warehouse solutions
-Determine all the multiple warehouse solutions
-Give a quality score to each solution based on distance, number of warehouses, customer reviews, and price

Calculating Emptiness of a warehouse for "Featured Warehouse" section
-Find how many days each warehouse has been filled for the last 6 months and next 6 months
-Set the top three most empty as the "Featured Warehouses"

Output of results
-Sorting options
--SpaceID (Default)
--Pricing
--Customer reviews
--Distance









Scheduling
input of when lessee wants the warehouse
SELECT calendar.StartDate, calendar.EndDate, spaces.Name
FROM calendar, spaces
WHERE calendar.SpaceId = spaces.SpaceID;
Check if the warehouse is available during dates between end date and start date


Pricing
  -Length of Lease
  -Distance
  -Size
  -Amenities
  -Storage Type (Climate Controlled, Outdoor, etc.)

** Price = Flat Fee + space price/sqft/mo * contracted space per type (sqft) * length of lease (months)

Best fit (Possible Solutions)
Point Based System
  -Location
  -Customer Needs
    -Climate Controlled, Outdoor, etc.
    -Size
      -Greedy Algorithm to decide if 1 or more are needed
  -Warehouse Owner Needs/ Constraints
    -How many spaces?
      -Split-able?
        -Size per space/ Number of spaces based on total area
        -Flexible?
  -Rating from Previous Customers
  -Decide if multiple warehouses are needed
  -If no good solutions, choose next best solutions

  Customer inputs filtering requirements
  Filter out unwanted locations
  Filter out locations without needed warehouse requirements (type, amenities)
  Decide if multiple warehouses are needed to meet size and find optimal solutions
  Sort on price or quality score or customer ratings

  Check the size on all warehouses
    Remove FALSE size warehouses
    if(size.warehouses[i] == sizeneeded)
    {
      warehousesleft <- c(warehousesleft, warehouse[i])
    }
  Check the Type on all TRUE size warehouses
    Remove FALSE types warehouses
    warehousesleft = NULL;
    if(type.warehouses[i] == typeneeded)
    {
      warehousesleft <- c(warehousesleft, warehouse[i])

Internal Quality Score:
Needs:
Location        | binary (if distance is met)        | int (sorted distances)
Warehouse Type  | binary (if need is met)            |
Size            | binary (if size is exceeded)       |
Price           | binary (if price is reasonable)    | int (sorted ascending)
Multiple Places | binary (if allowed)                |
Amenities       | binary (if required)
  -Loading Dock
  -Provided moving services in warehouse
  -Electricity
  -Restrooms
  -Secure
  -Access 24x7

Review Score:
  -5 star System
  -Comments
  -binary (if meets minimum review rating)
  -int (sort customer reviews)


Figure out priorities for search

We want to optimize our code when we discover our code takes too long

Maybe sort by state regions, such as if I want California, the algorithm will check NV, OR, and AR before using the Google API.



Good Pseudocode for Quality Check:
Get input from lessee on warehouse types
Verify all binary checks
--Location
--Warehouse Type
--Size
--Multiple Locations
--Amenities
--Available
--Price
If a warehouse passes a check make a new array with only those, run next check on new list



Optimized Location Search:
Customer inputs wanted location of warehouse('s)
Filter only warehouses that are available during the requested dates
Take state of desired location
Keep only the desired state and a region of states around inputted state (e.g. IN will search OH, MI, IL, KY for warehouses)
If the list of warehouses is less than a predefined amount (i.e. 50), search the bordering states of the original bordering states for new DISTINCT warehouses.
e.g:
OH: PA, WV, KY, IN
KY: IN, OH, WV, VI, TN, IL
IL: IN, KY, MISSOURI, IOWA, WI
MI: WI, IL, IN, OH
Continue until a large enough sample size exists
Run the binary checks
Use Google API to calculate distance between warehouse and desired location
Sort on distance, customer rating, etc.
